# Employee Survey Analysis

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Employee Survey Analysis project. This project is based on the research paper, "Decoding the Workplace & EOR: An Employee Survey Analysis by Data Science Techniques and Visualization".

## Project Overview

Our project explores the dynamics of employee-organization relationships (EOR) using advanced data science methodologies, demonstrating findings through accessible and intuitive visualizations. We leverage a dataset obtained from a comprehensive nationwide employee survey to provide detailed visual insights into various aspects of the modern workplace.

Key visualizations provided by our project include:

- Demographic analysis
- Workforce satisfaction
- Work environment scrutiny
- Employee views via word cloud interpretations
- Burnout predictions

These visualizations underscore the significant implications of data science across various management sectors, enhancing the understanding of workplace dynamics and promoting mutual growth and satisfaction.

## Aim and Scope

This project aims to enhance the findings of researchers in sociology, management, HR professionals, and companies seeking a detailed understanding of their workforce's satisfaction. By focusing on practicality and interpretability, our project caters to a diverse array of readership. From theoretical researchers using our state-of-the-art visualizations to firms seeking insights into their workforce, our project is designed to resonate with diverse interests.

Beyond merely understanding workforce dynamics, our research encourages proactive measures to improve workplace environments, boost employee satisfaction, and foster healthier, more productive organizations.

## Potential Impact

Our project stands as a testament to the profound implications of data science across various management sectors, particularly within the realm of employee-organization relationships. Harnessing data science techniques for future research endeavors, this project serves as a valuable tool for those committed to improving workplace dynamics and fostering healthier organizations.
